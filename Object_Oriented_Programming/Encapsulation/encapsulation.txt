Encapsulation refers to the bundling of fields and methods inside a single class. It prevents outer classes from accessing 
and changing fields and methods of a class. This also helps to achieve data hiding.

Encapsulation refers to the bundling of related fields and methods together. 
This can be used to achieve data hiding. Encapsulation in itself is not data hiding.

Why Encapsulation?
    *Encapsulation helps us to keep related fields and methods togethe.

    *It helps to control the values of our data fields.
    
    *It helps to decouple components of a system. We can encapsulate code into multiple bundles.
     These decoupled components (bundle) can be developed, tested, and debugged independently and concurrently. 
     And, any changes in a particular component do not have any effect on other components.
    
    *We can also achieve data hiding using encapsulation.
