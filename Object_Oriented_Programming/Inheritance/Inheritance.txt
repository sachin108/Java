Inheritance allows us to create a new class from an existing class.

The new class that is created is known as subclass (child or derived class) 
and the existing class from where the child class is derived is known as superclass (parent or base class).

In Java, inheritance is an is-a relationship. That is, we use inheritance only if there exists an is-a 
relationship between two classes. 
    Car is a Vehicle
    Orange is a Fruit
    Surgeon is a Doctor
    Dog is an Animal
