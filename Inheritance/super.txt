The super keyword in Java is used in subclasses to access superclass members (attributes, constructors and methods).

Uses of super keyword
    To call methods of the superclass that is overridden in the subclass.
    To access attributes (fields) of the superclass if both superclass and subclass have attributes with the same name.
    To explicitly call superclass no-arg (default) or parameterized constructor from the subclass constructor.

super() keyword is required if the parameterized constructor (a constructor that takes arguments) 
of the superclass has to be called from the subclass constructor. The compiler will not call default
constructor in this case...

The parameterized super() must always be the first statement in the body of the constructor of the 
subclass, otherwise, we get a compilation error.
