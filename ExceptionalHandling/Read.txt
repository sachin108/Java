An exception is an unexpected event that occurs during program execution. 
It affects the flow of the program instructions which can cause the program to terminate abnormally.
An exception can occur for many reasons. Some of them are:
        Invalid user input
        Device failure
        Loss of network connection
        memory limitations
        Code errors
        Opening an unavailable file

Exception hierarchy in JAVA:
    -->Throwable
            -->Error
            -->Exception
                    -->IOException aka checked exception
                        eg: FileNotFoundException

                    -->RuntimeException aka unchecked exceptions
                        eg: IllegalArgumentException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException

    * Throwable class is the root class in the hierarchy.

    * Errors represent irrecoverable conditions such as Java virtual machine (JVM) running out of memory, memory leaks, stack overflow errors, library incompatibility, infinite recursion, etc.
    
    * Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program. When an exception occurs within a method, it creates an object. This object is called the exception object.
      It contains information about the exception such as the name and description of the exception and state of the program when the exception occurred.
