A thread in Java at any point of time exists in any one of the following states.
    1. New
    2. Runnable
    3. Blocked
    4. Waiting
    5. Timed Waiting
    6. Terminated

    New Thread: 
        When a new thread is created, it is in the new state. The thread has not yet started to run when the thread is in this state. 
        When a thread lies in the new state, its code is yet to be run and hasn’t started to execute.

    Runnable State: 
        A thread that is ready to run is moved to a runnable state. In this state, a thread might actually be running or it might be ready 
        to run at any instant of time. It is the responsibility of the thread scheduler to give the thread, time to run. 
        A multi-threaded program allocates a fixed amount of time to each individual thread. Each and every thread runs for a short while and 
        then pauses and relinquishes the CPU to another thread so that other threads can get a chance to run. When this happens, all such threads 
        that are ready to run, waiting for the CPU and the currently running thread lie in a runnable state.
    
    Blocked/Waiting state: 
        When a thread is temporarily inactive, then it’s in one of the following states: 
            Blocked
            Waiting
    
    Timed Waiting: 
        A thread lies in a timed waiting state when it calls a method with a time-out parameter. A thread lies in this state until the timeout 
        is completed or until a notification is received. For example, when a thread calls sleep or a conditional wait, it is moved to a timed waiting state.
    
    Terminated State: 
        A thread terminates because of either of the following reasons: 
            Because it exits normally. This happens when the code of the thread has been entirely executed by the program.
            Because there occurred some unusual erroneous event, like segmentation fault or an unhandled exception.
