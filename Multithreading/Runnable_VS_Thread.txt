Thread Class vs Runnable Interface 
    * If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance. 
      But, if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base classes.

    * We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because it provides some inbuilt methods like 
      yield(), interrupt() etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.
