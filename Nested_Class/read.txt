There are two types of nested classes you can create in Java.
    *Non-static nested class (inner class)
        A non-static nested class is a class within another class. It has access to members of the enclosing class (outer class). 
        Also known as inner class. Since the inner class exists within the outer class, **you must instantiate the outer class first, 
        in order to instantiate the inner class**

        Using the instance of the outer class, we then created objects of inner classes using .(dot) operator

    *Static nested class
        A static class inside another class. Such class is known as static nested class. Static nested classes are not called static inner classes.
        Unlike inner class, a static nested class cannot access the member variables of the outer class. It is because the static nested class doesn't 
        require you to create an instance of the outer class.
