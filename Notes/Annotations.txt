* Java annotations are metadata (data about data) for our program source code.
* They provide additional information about the program to the compiler but are not part of the program itself. 
  These annotations do not affect the execution of the compiled program.
* Annotations start with @.
    eg: @Override
            It is not mandatory to use @Override when overriding a method. However, if we use it, the compiler gives an error 
            if something is wrong (such as wrong parameter type) while overriding the method.

        @SuppressWarnings
        @Deprecated
        @FunctionalInterface
        @Documented
        @Inherited
        @Repeatable

* Some annotations can be defined to give instructions to the program at runtime. 
* Annotations can be used for giving instructions to the compiler, detect errors or suppress warnings
