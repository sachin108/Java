Association
    Aggregation(has-a relationship/ unidirectional association/ weak Composition)
        Composition(part-of relationship/ strong Composition)

-->Association is a relation between two separate classes which establishes through their Objects. 

-->Association can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many. 

-->In OOP, an Object communicates to another object to use functionality and services provided 
by that object. 

-->Composition and Aggregation are the two forms of association. 

Aggregation:
    both entities can survive individually

Composition:
    both entities are dependent on each other.
    the composed object cannot exist without the other entity.
