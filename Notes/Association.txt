Association
    Aggregation(has-a relationship/ unidirectional association/ weak Composition)
        Composition(part-of relationship/ strong Composition)

-->Association is a relation between two separate classes which establishes through their Objects. 

-->Association can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many. 

-->In OOP, an Object communicates to another object to use functionality and services provided 
by that object. 

-->Composition and Aggregation are the two forms of association. 

Aggregation:
    both entities can survive individually
    Code reusability

Composition:
    both entities are dependent on each other.
    the composed object cannot exist without the other entity.

Aggregation eg-:

    class Address{
        String street; int streetNo;
    }

    class Student{
        Address ofStudent;
        String name;
    }

Composition eg-:
    
    class Car{
        Car(Engine engine){
            // ...
        }
        //object of car can;t be created without and engine
    }

    class Engine{
            
    }


Aggregation
    When you want to use some property or behaviour of any class without the requirement of modifying it 
    or adding more functionality to it, in such case Aggregation is a better option because in case of 
    Aggregation we are just using any external class inside our class as a variable.

Inheritance
    When you want to use and modify some property or behaviour of any external class or may be want to 
    add more function on top of it, its best to use Inheritance.
