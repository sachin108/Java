Access modifiers are used to set the accessibility (visibility) of classes, 
interfaces, variables, methods, constructors, data members, and getter & setter methods.

Public          declarations are visible everywhere

Protected       declarations are visible within the package or all subclasses

Default         declarations are visible only within the package (package private)
		
Private         declarations are visible within the class only
    
    Least to most restricted:
            Default > protected

We cannot declare classes and interfaces private in Java. However, the nested 
classes can be declared private.

We cannot declare classes or interfaces protected in Java.

Access modifiers are mainly used for encapsulation. It can help us to control what
part of a program can access the members of a class. So that misuse of data can be
prevented.
